# .gitignore file for Xcode4 / OS X Source projects
#
# NB: if you are storing "built" products, this WILL NOT WORK,
#   and you should use a different .gitignore (or none at all)
# This file is for SOURCE projects, where there are many extra
#   files that we want to exclude
#
# For updates, see: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/49478/git-ignore-file-for-xcode-projects

## Xcode 4 - semi-personal settings, often included in workspaces
##
## You can safely ignore the xcuserdata files - but do NOT ignore the files next to them

## XCode 4 workspaces - more detailed
##
## Workspaces are important! They are a core feature of Xcode - don't exclude them :)
##
## Workspace layout is quite spammy. For reference:
##
## (root)/
##   (project-name).xcodeproj/
##     project.pbxproj
##     project.xcworkspace/
##       contents.xcworkspacedata
##       xcuserdata/
##         (your name)/xcuserdatad/
##     xcuserdata/
##       (your name)/xcuserdatad/

## Xcode 4 workspaces - SHARED
##
## This is UNDOCUMENTED (google: "developer.apple.com xcshareddata" - 0 results
## But if you're going to kill personal workspaces, at least keep the shared ones...
##
##
!xcshareddata

# Xcode 4 - Deprecated classes
#
# Allegedly, if you manually "deprecate" your classes, they get moved here.
#
# We're using source-control, so this is a "feature" that we do not want!
